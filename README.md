# 🌀 AnimeHub

Welcome to **AnimeHub** – your one-stop web app for anime exploration, obsession, and accidental 12-hour binges. Built for weebs, by weebs (and maybe a little too much coffee). 💻☕

Whether you're searching for that one anime with the guy who yells a lot (*so… all of them?*), or just looking to fill the void left after the last season ended — AnimeHub has your back.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Search** for your favorite anime faster than Kirito can dual-wield
- 📺 **Watch trailers** and view info (No spoilers, promise!)
- ❤️ **Add to favorites** and build your "watch later but probably never" list
- 🕶️ Clean UI so fresh even Levi would approve
- 🌀 Smooth animations that would make a Studio Ghibli scene jealous

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

AnimeHub is forged in the fires of Mount TypeScript with some sleek frameworks and shiny libraries:

- ⚛️ [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – because server-side rendering is our ninja way
- 🔡 TypeScript – typed like a true shonen protagonist's power level
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS – styling faster than a Naruto run
- 💃 Framer Motion – buttery animations smoother than your husbando's voice
- 🌟 React Icons – icons sharper than a Zanpakuto

## 💻 Getting Started

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and let the binge begin.
